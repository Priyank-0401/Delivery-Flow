This is actually the most important question you've asked so far.

Because right now, if you build the project exactly as described, **90% of it is not AI.**

And that's perfectly fine.

A lot of products slap "AI-powered" on top of dashboards and call it a day.

Let's break it down.

---

## What is NOT AI

These features are traditional software engineering:

* Dependency graph
* Critical path calculation
* Bottleneck detection
* Health score calculation
* Team workload analysis
* Sprint metrics
* Release risk rules
* Dashboard generation

All of these can be implemented using:

* Graph algorithms
* Business rules
* Statistical calculations

No AI required.

## Where AI Actually Adds Value

### AI Feature #1: Executive Summary Generation

Instead of showing:

```text
Velocity: -18%
Blocked Tasks: 7
Risk Score: 82
```

AI generates:

> Project Phoenix is currently at elevated delivery risk. Velocity has declined by 18% over the last two sprints while seven critical tasks remain blocked by cross-team dependencies. Current release confidence is estimated at 62%.

This is an actual LLM use case.

Could use:

* GPT
* Claude
* Gemini
* Llama

---

### AI Feature #2: Risk Explanation Engine

Without AI:

```text
Risk Score = 82
```

With AI:

> The primary contributor to project risk is the Payment Service dependency. Three downstream teams are blocked waiting for API completion. Historical sprint data suggests similar dependency patterns caused delays averaging 8 days.

This feels intelligent.

---

### AI Feature #3: Ask DeliveryFlow

PM asks:

> Why is Sprint 14 behind?

AI analyzes:

* Jira data
* Dependency graph
* Sprint metrics
* Workload data

Then answers naturally.

This is probably the strongest AI feature.

---

### AI Feature #4: Recommendation Engine

AI suggests:

> Move AUTH-17 from Team A to Team B.

or

> Split Epic E-43 into two sprints.

or

> QA capacity is underutilized by 30%.

This feels very PM-oriented.

---

## The Really Advanced Version

This is where it becomes genuinely impressive.

Build a RAG system.

### Knowledge Sources

* Jira tickets
* Sprint retrospectives
* Incident reports
* Confluence docs
* Project plans

Store them in a vector database.

Then PM asks:

> Have we encountered similar delays before?

AI searches historical projects and answers.

Now you're entering startup-level product territory.

## What I'd Do If I Were Building This

### Phase 1 (MVP)

No AI.

Just:

* Dependency Engine
* Health Score
* Risk Calculation
* Workload Analytics

Get the product working.

---

### Phase 2

Add LLM.

Use:

[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

or

[Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

for:

* summaries
* recommendations
* explanations

---

### Phase 3

Add RAG.

Store:

* project history
* sprint notes
* risk logs

Then create:

> Ask DeliveryFlow

This becomes your flagship AI feature.

---

So if you're asking me honestly:

**Should the project be marketed as AI-powered today?**

Not yet.

Right now the strongest part of the idea is actually the **Delivery Intelligence Platform** itself.

The AI layer should be the icing on the cake, not the cake.

A recruiter will be more impressed by:

> "I built a dependency intelligence engine that predicts release delays"

than by

> "I built an AI dashboard"

because the first statement sounds like a product and the second sounds like a trend.
